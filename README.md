To start the game:

	-Open a command prompt/terminal in the python_blackjack directory

	-To run on Linux or macOS, run the command "python3 blackjack.py"

	-To run on Windows, run the command "py blackjack.py"

Game is now in a fully playable state, I'm fixing bugs as they show up.
I've fixed the majority of the bugs, and I'm adding additional UI features as I come up with new ideas.

Known issues: game still sometimes showing incorrect winner when there is a split

This is the biggest programming project that I've undertook thus far by a longshot, and I'm really happy with how it has turned out.

To anyone kind enough to sit down and play this for a bit:
If you experience any strange game behaviors or crashes, please post an issue on the github repo so I can find and fix the bug.

Thanks for checking out my code!
