Game is now in a playable state, still working on interface as well as ironing out remaining bugs.

The split function makes much more sense to use now, however the interface is still a WIP. I've succeeded in printing the separate hands
in a split scenario on the same line, but I'm still ironing out some bugs concerning what the program outputs during a split when
one of the hands goes bust.

The program probably won't full on crash at this stage, but no guarantees.

Game may behave strangely, such as not registering a bust, etc.

To anyone kind enough to sit down and play this for a bit:
If you experience any strange game behaviors or crashes, please post an issue on the github repo so I can find and fix the bug.

Thanks for checking out my code!
